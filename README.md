# Insurance
<h3><b>Solve exam question </b></h3>
Analyze the specification below regarding an insurance contract:

--------------------------------------------------
The basic insurance premium is determined by the Horse Power (HP) of the car:

Under 50 HP - the basic premium is £400

Up to 100 HP - the basic premium is £600

The premium increases by £3.80 for every 1 HP after that

For sports cars newer than 4 years, the basic premium is increased by a

further 8% although this is reduced to 4% for older ones (sports cars).


--------------------------------------------------

If the car is parked in the street overnight an additional 8% is payable; however if

the car is parked in a garage a 2% discount is allowed.
